# Photovoltaic-defect-detection
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify defects in photovoltaic cells using Electroluminescence (EL) images.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal is to detect and classify four types of defects in photovoltaic cells using deep learning. This notebook focuses specifically on building and evaluating a custom CNN architecture.

## Model Details
- A custom CNN was designed with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- Trained on EL images divided into four defect classes.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to measure performance.

## üîç Key Features
- Preprocessing of EL image data for CNN input.
- Custom CNN architecture implemented using TensorFlow.
- Training and validation performance tracking.
- Visualization of training loss and accuracy curves.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
